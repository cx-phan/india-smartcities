distribution stations, O&M of borewells, SITC work of electrical & mechanical

department, construction of new bore wells, augmentation & energy efficiency

The Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) is responsible for
overseeing and sanctioning construction and infrastructure development across
the suburbs of the city of Ahmadabad. The prime objective of the AUDA's
formation was to carry out the planned development of the area failing outside
the periphery of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Recently the area of working
of AUDA has been limited due to merger of 18 Gram Panchanyats of
Ahmedabad district with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. AUDA
completed many works in the metro region of Ahmedabad. The development
authority is coming up with a state-of-the-art office on Ashram Road, Ahmadabad."
