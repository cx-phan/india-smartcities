4. Political Profile: Leadership and Administrative Structure,
"Architecture of Governance
Structure of Elected and Executive Bodies. Give
indication of hierarchies","The governing structure of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) consists of both
political and administrative wings. The political wing is an elected body of
councillors headed by a Mayor. A deputy mayor assists the mayor and both are
elected from amongst the corporators. The term of both the mayor and his
deputy, is for a period of five years. The Commissioner heads the administrative
wing and is responsible for the strategic and operational planning and
management of the Corporation. The Commissioner takes the decisions on
behalf of the Board or the Standing Committee formed from the elected
Councillors, while performing the duties of the Corporation.
In Gujarat, the municipal administration comes under the purview of Urban
Development and Urban Housing Department. It is the policy making body for the
urban sector in the state and undertakes the functions as specified in the local
Acts. After 1994, significant changes were made in the administrative setup of
SMC, from a vertical-rigid-hierarchical system to a horizontally-more-interactive
system. There has been a shift to ‘field level operations’. Decentralization of
administration is a major aspect of this change. The city has been divided into
seven zones viz. Varachcha (East), Rander (west), Katargam (North), Udhna
(South), Limbayat (South-East), Athwa Lines (SouthWest) and Muglisara
(Central). Each zone is vested with complete authority to address local problems
and mitigate them at the source. Further, transparency and collective decision
making have become key elements of the administrative process.
Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) is responsible for development in
systematic manner and to control unplanned and unauthorized development. To
ensure aforesaid functions, SUDA prepares Development Plans and Town
Planning Schemes."
