India Smart City Profile

City: Delhi
State: New Delhi
Category: Capital, Tier 1
The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) is one of three statutory urban regions within the state of Delhi, the other two being the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the Delhi Cantonment Board (DCB). The NDMC lies within the urban agglomeration of Delhi
Metropolitan and since the urban region is part of the National Capital Region, it is jointly governed by local municipal as well as the
state and federal governments. The area within the NDMC covers central parts of Delhi which were planned and developed by British
architect Sir Edwin Lutyens as the British capital of India which was inaugurated in 1931. Today, this area remains the seat of
government for the India, and continues to house government offices and diplomatic missions. Although New Delhi is the largest
commercial centre in northern India, parts of the NDMC face considerable challenges with air pollution, traffic congestion, and
densification.
