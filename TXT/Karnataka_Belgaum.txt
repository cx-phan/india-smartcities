India Smart City Profile

City: Belgaum
State: Karnataka
Category: Business & Industrial Centre, Tier 2
The city of Belgaum is located at the northern tip of Karnataka, and borders the adjoining states of Maharashtra and Goa. There is a proposal to
make Belgaum the second capital of Karnataka, owing to its commercial and industrial importance within the state. Belgaum ranks second to
Bangalore in terms of overall exports in Karnataka, which can largely be attributed to the region’s flourishing automotive industry. Belgaum is also
recognized for its enormous contribution to sugarcane cultivation and production of sugar. The region is blessed with high contents of bauxite and
uranium, which has led to the establishment of many automotive and metal casting industries close to the city. A special economic zone (SEZ)
dedicated to aerospace engineering is soon being set up in Belgaum, as the city also serves as a major training centre and cantonment base for
the Indian Armed Forces.
