City: Maharashtra
State: Pune

Category: Business & Industrial Centre, Tier 2

Pune is the second largest city in Maharashtra and the ninth most-populous city in India. The metropolitan area
consists of two municipal corporations (including Pune) and three cantonments Pune is located 150 km south-east of
Mumbai, and the two cities are connected by an express highway. Pune has historically been an important economic
hub in Maharashtra and continues to be so today, owing to the growing number of industries in the region: the
automotive sector being most prominent. The industrial township of Pimpri-Chinchwad, just north of Pune city,
houses over 4000 manufacturing units that contributes to the city’s economy. Pune is also the headquarters (south
command) of the Indian Air Force and a large military training base. IT and education are the other dominant sectors
that attract a large population of young professionals to the city. As a result, a new IT park is being developed by the
Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) to accommodate this growth. Other recent large scale
investments in Pune include a Food Cluster Development project, aided by the World Bank, and an International
Exhibition and Convention centre, set to open in 2017.
